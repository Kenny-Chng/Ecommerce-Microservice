This is my first project using Go and I decided to create a e commerce microservice with Go. 

What this microservice does is that it allows us to be able to see when a product was added to cart, shipped, and delivered, price, and all other useful things related to a e commerce product. 

We are able to add products through our database of Redis. I also heard about Redis and took the time to learn more about it to incorproate the project rather than use MySQL or noSql databases.
